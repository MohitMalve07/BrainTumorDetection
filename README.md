AI Brain Tumor Detection (Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV)
Developed and deployed a machine learning pipeline for brain tumor classification using MRI imaging datasets.
Implemented preprocessing techniques (grayscale normalization, noise reduction, segmentation) to improve model accuracy.
Trained deep learning models (CNNs using TensorFlow/Keras) and optimized hyperparameters to achieve high precision and recall.
Built custom scripts for data augmentation and batch processing to handle imbalanced datasets and improve generalization.
Validated model performance with metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, F1-score) and cross-validation on real-world medical datasets.
Documented the workflow and deployed a prototype for potential early-detection applications in healthcare.
